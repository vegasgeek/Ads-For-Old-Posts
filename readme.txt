Ads For Old Posts inserts ads into posts older than a certain amount of days.

== Description ==

Ads For Old Posts inserts ads into posts older than a certain amount of days. 

On the options page you'll be able to set the location and design for your ad block. You can force ads to display at the start or end of a post, or you can now use the [afop] shortcode to manually insert the adblock in the middle of a page or post.

Note: In version 2.0 we rewrote how the data is stored in the database. If after you upgrade your ads aren't showing, deactivate the plugin and reactivate it.

== Installation ==

Upload the Ads For Old Posts plugin to your blog, Activate it, then edit the options from the settings screen.
